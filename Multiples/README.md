# Multiples Assignment
The Multiples Assignment tests your ability to interpret a difficult concept and convert it to code

## Details
Using any language you want (including pseudo-code), write a program, function, method, or class, that takes in 3 integers `x`, `y`, and `z` and prints out every `x` multiple of `y` greater than `z`

For example, if x is 3, y is 4, and z is 5, then your program should output:
```
8
12
16
```

If x is 5, y is 80, and z is 201, then your program should output:
```
240
320
400
480
560
```

If x is 4, y is 13, and z is 1469, then your program should output
```
1482
1495
1508
1521
```

If x is 3, y is 5, and z is 10, then your program should output
```
15
20
25
```

## Acceptance Criteria
 - If you are using pseudo code, then describe how your code would solve the problem by talking through one of the examples.
 - If you are not using pseudo code, then your program can take in arguments from the 4 examples above and outputs the correct output as shown.

## Hints

 - This problem is hard to conceptualize, but easy to implement. Try to understand the whole problem before typing up a solution.
 - There's 3 parameters. 1 of them should only be used for iterations and not for calculations. That leaves the tough calculations to 2 parameters.
 - If you're stuck, feel free to ask for help.
