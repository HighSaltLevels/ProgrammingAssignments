# Optimus Prime Programming Assignment

The Optimus Prime Programming Assignment tests basic logic skills.

## Details

Using any programming language you like (including pseudo-code), write a program that loops through the first 100 positive integers (1 to 100).

 - If the integer is divisible by 3, print out "Optimus" followed by the integer.
 - If the integer is divisible by 5, print out "Prime" followed by the integer.
 - If the integer is divisible by 3 and 5, then print out "Optimus Prime" followed by the integer.

For example, if the integer is 45, then the program should print out `Optimus Prime 45`.

## Acceptance Criteria
 - Print "No Decepticons" at the beginning of your program execution.
 - If you are using pseudo code talk through your code and explain why it would solve this assignment.
 - If you are not using pseudo code, the output of your code should be the same as below (without hardcoding).

## Hints
 - Be sure to read through and understand all of the acceptance criteria.
 - What's a good way to find out if a number is divisible by another? It might have to do with remainders :thinking:
 - If you run into trouble or have any confusion, feel free to ask for clarification on acceptance criteria or ask for help.
